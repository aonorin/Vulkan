VulKan ToolS (VKTS) Exporter:
-----------------------------

This folder contains the [Blender](http://www.blender.org) exporter for the VKTS scene file format.

To use the Blender exporter, copy the folder `io_scene` and its content of the `Blender` folder  
into the following subfolder of your Blender installation:

`X.XX/scripts/addons`, where `X.XX` is the Blender version.

After this, the exporter has to be enabled in the Add-ons tab of the user preferences inside Blender.
